# Machine Learning with PyTorch

### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/PyTorch by Data For Science.

PyTorch is the most popular framework for high-performance numerical computation across a wide range of CPU and GPU hardware. While originally intended for quick development of Deep Learning applications, PyTorch is capable of much more and easily applicable to a wide range of numerical applications. In this course, you learn how to leverage the ease of use and power of PyTorch for all your Machine Learning needs. We introduce classical ML and Deep Learning algorithms, analyze their pros and cons, explore the best way to evaluate their performance, and practice how to implement them using PyTorch through a number of practical examples designed to best get you up and running quickly.
